### Pixel Template Production
Code for production of pixel templates for CMS

Everything is run standalone from cmssw but uses some of its code

The script **fetch_cmssw_code.sh** grabs the latest version of all the needed pixel code from the [cmssw github](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw)

In order to compile properly you must have [vdt](https://github.com/dpiparo/vdt) installed to /usr/local/
