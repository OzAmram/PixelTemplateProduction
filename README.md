Code for production of pixel templates

This is done stand alone from cmssw but shares some of the same code
The script *fetch_cmssw_code.sh* grabs the latest version of all the needed pixel code from the cmssw github

In order to compile properly you must have [vdt](https://github.com/dpiparo/vdt) installed to /usr/local/
